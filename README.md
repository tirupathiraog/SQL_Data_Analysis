## 📘 Introduction

This project explores workforce trends through SQL-based data analysis.
It focuses on understanding **job market dynamics**, **salary structures**, and **demand for different job roles** using powerful SQL queries.

The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can extract valuable insights from large datasets and help make data-driven decisions in hiring and workforce planning.

## 📚 Background

The dataset contains details about job postings, including:

* Job Titles
* Company Names
* Locations
* Employment Types
* Average Yearly Salaries

By analyzing this data, we can uncover trends such as the most in-demand roles, salary ranges, and patterns across industries and locations.

## 📊 Analysis Performed

The following key analyses were conducted using SQL:

1. 🔍 **Job Demand Analysis** – Find the most common job titles
2. 💰 **Salary Analysis** – Compare average and total salaries by job role
3. 🏙️ **Location-Based Insights** – Identify top-paying cities and regions
4. 🧩 **Salary Categorization** – Classify salaries into *Low*, *Medium*, *High*
5. 📈 **Top Companies Analysis** – Discover top employers based on salary and demand

Sample Query Example:

```sql
SELECT 
    job_title_short,
    CASE
       WHEN salary_year_avg < 50000 THEN 'Low'
       WHEN salary_year_avg BETWEEN 50000 AND 60000 THEN 'Medium'
       WHEN salary_year_avg > 60000 THEN 'High'
       ELSE 'Others'
    END AS salary_category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_jobs
FROM job_postings_fact
GROUP BY job_title_short, salary_category;
```

## 💡 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

* **Data cleaning and validation** in SQL
* **Aggregation functions** (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
* **Joins and Subqueries** for relational analysis
* **CASE WHEN logic** for conditional grouping
* Turning raw data into **meaningful business insights**

## 🏁 Conclusion

The **Workforce Analysis Project** highlights how SQL serves as a strong foundation for data analytics.
It shows how structured querying can answer real-world business questions about hiring, compensation, and job market trends.
